Diff Tools Plugin for Bazaar (bzr)
=====================================

This plugin enables the use of a variety of graphical diff tools with Bazaar,
by adding a new '--using' option to the 'bzr diff' command.  For example:

   bzr diff --using kompare -r last:2 foo.c

would use 'kompare' in place of the builtin 'bzr diff' behavior.

If the '--using' option is omitted, then 'bzr diff' proceeds normally.  If the
'--diff-options' is given, it will be passed through to the graphical diff tool.
The '--prefix' option is currently ignored.  

All forms of the '--revision' option are supported.

To install the plugin, just copy the module into the plugins directory:

   cd $WHERE_YOU_HAVE_BZR_DIFFTOOLS
   mkdir $HOME/.bazaar/plugins/difftools
   cp *.py $HOME/.bazaar/plugins/difftools

Diff tools that are known to work with this plugin include:

   fldiff
   kdiff3
   kompare
   meld
   vimdiff
   WinMerge
   xxdiff

and any other similar tool will probably work as well.  

Although many of the graphical diff tools are capable of 3-way comparisons,
this plugin only supports 2-way comparisons, the same as the builtin 'bzr diff'
command.


Tips:

* Adjust the preferences on the graphical diff tool to ignore the '.bzr' files.
  Unfortunately, each tool has its own method for doing this, and most of them
  cannot be scripted.

* Add an alias to $HOME/.bazaar/bazaar.conf to save typing, for example:

    [ALIASES]
    mdiff = diff --using meld
